<p class="excerpt">
    Pierre Richard is one of the greatest and most talented French comedians in the last 50 years.
    He is also a film director and occasional singer.
</p>
<p class="text">
    Pierre Richard was born in a Bourgeois family from Valenciennes. He is the grandson of Léopold Defays who was the director of the company Escaut-et-Meuse.
    His name comes from the stage name of Pierre Richard-Willm who was his mother's favorite actor. Pierre Richard spent his childhood and a part of his
    teenage years in his native city where he was a student at the Henri-Wallon high school.
    Skipping classes regularly to go to the cinema, it was Danny Kaye in Up in Arms that revealed his vocation. This being received with only a moderate
    enthusiasm by his family, he had to learn a real profession. He then studied kinesiotherapy without renouncing acting.
